### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ilan, a graduate student at the University of Toronto studying artificial intelligence and computer science. 

I love working on challenging problems, in various areas such as machine learning and distributed systems. 

I enjoy contributing to open source projects, collaborating with others and always looking for more opportunities. Previously, I contributed to the [Cortex](https://github.com/cortexproject) and [ACK](https://github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/prometheusservice-controller) open source projects.
